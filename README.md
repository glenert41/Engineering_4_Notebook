## Introductory Raspberry Pi Assignments






### Hello Raspberry Pi

#### Description:

This is is Hello Raspberry Pi module. In this module, we connect the Raspberry Pi to our computer, and open the editor, in this case, Beagle Term. Then we had to make a basic program.

#### Reflection:

This module took 7 hours, although it was very easy. My issue was that when I open Beagle Term and hit enter, I do not get any response. The solution was to switch my TX and RX cables, as the label on them was incorrect.









### Get Your Pi Online

#### Description
This is the Get your Pi Online module. In this module, we had to connect our Pi to the internet, and then add the file from the Hello Raspberry Pi module to our Git Hub. We created folder on the Pi for our Engineering 4 Notebook Repo, and then we committed and pushed the file and folder to our Git Hub.

This module took a bit of thinking and genuinely was difficult at times; the biggest take away for me was that you should not just type in what Dr. Shields has in the video, you should understand what each line, and really each word, does, as Beagle Term and Raspberry Pi can be unforgiving for learners like me. Also, when pushing to master, you may have to type main --- (git push origin master) or (git push origin main)

                                     
                                     
                                     
                                     
                                     
                                     
### Hello Python (Dice Roller)

#### Description
This is from the Hello Python module. In this module, we had to create a python file that would roll a die when enter was pressed, and when x was pressed, the program would quit.

#### Reflection

This module was definitely the most challenging to date. It really made me rely on the skills I developed in the prior assignments. I think, as mentioned in the previous module, that going back throught the assignment video and watching/noting what each line does really helped. The hard part for me wasn't writing the actual code, but rather manuvering through the Raspberry Pi interface; however I think I have the basics down now. On issue I had was how to detect if enter was pressed with an input, the way to solve this is by leaving the quotes blank in between. For example, instead of ("ENTER") just do (" ")





### Program 01 - Calculator

#### Description

In this module, we had to make a calculator in python. Essentially, we had to have the user input 2 numbers, then run those numbers through one function, and recieve the results of the 5 different operators (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulo)

This module was very fun for me. At first, I went through and didn't use a function (Which cost me a class period of work because I didn't fully read the directions. Life lesson 1 -- read the directions.) Anyways, my biggest takeaway from this module was really reafirriming how to use functions in python with parameters. Essentially, in the function definition, you have to declare that this function will need parameters (values) in order to run, and then it will use those values you give the function when you call it later on to give you the result.




### Program 02 - Quadratic Solver

#### Description

In this module, we had to make a quadratic solver, meaning the user would give their a,b, & c values for standard form of a quadratic, and then the program would produce the roots, and if there were no roots, then the program would produce that there were no roots.

This module was pretty straight forward. It was cool to see the power that arrays had, and I definitely plan to use them in the future. The hardest part for me though was getting used to arrays. You can print the values of the array, and even print the array, but there will still be brackets around the values. In this case, you have to place a string of the value of each position in the array. Something that I thought was cool though is that you are able to mix numbers and letters in an array, which lets you store different types of values in one array. Also, if you want to add a value to an array, you have to add append it (ARRAYNAME.append("value")).
