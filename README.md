## Introductory Raspberry Pi Assignments

### Hello Raspberry Pi

This is is Hello Raspberry Pi module. In this module, we connect the Raspberry Pi to our computer, and open the editor, in this case, Beagle Term. This module took 7 hours, although it was very easy. My issue was that when I open Beagle Term and hit enter, I do not get any response. The solution was to switch my TX and RX cables, as the label on them was incorrect.

### Get Your Pi Online

This is the Get your Pi Online module. In this module, we had to connect our Pi to the internet, and then add the file from the Hello Raspberry Pi module to our Git Hub. We created folder on the Pi for our Engineering 4 Notebook Repo, and then we committed and pushed the file and folder to our Git Hub. This module took a bit of thinking and genuinely was difficult at times; the biggest take away for me was that you should not just type in what Dr. Shields has in the video, you should understand what each line, and really each word, does, as Beagle Term and Raspberry Pi can be unforgiving for learners like me.

### Hello Python (Dice Roller)

This is from the Hello Python module. In this module, we had to create a python file that would roll a die when enter was pressed, and when x was pressed, the program would quit.

This module was definitely the most challenging to date. It really made me rely on the skills I developed in the prior assignments. I think, as mentioned in the previous module, that going back throught the assignment video and watching/noting what each line does really helped. The hard part for me wasn't writing the actual code, but rather manuvering through the Raspberry Pi interface; however I think I have the basics down now.
